                <p>
                    I am an accomplished SAS analyst with over 6 years of experience in the finance and IT sector in which I have
                    consistently demonstrated my expertise in development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond my proficiency in SAS, I've also engaged with languages such as Excel VBA, Python, and JavaScript, albeit
                    at a relatively foundational level. This diverse exposure has fuelled my enthusiasm for exploring new technical
                    horizons. I thrive on taking the technical lead for diverse projects, successfully transforming stakeholder requests
                    into tangible solutions from conceptualization to execution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am now actively seeking opportunities to solidify and expand my technical repertoire, facilitating meaningful
                    engagements with colleagues and clients and propelling the growth and success of the teams I work with.

                <p>
                    Collaborated with a business analyst to integrate Basel 3.1 regulatory changes into the
                    codebase. Streamlined and optimised calculation processes for compliance and precise
                    output formatting to meet stakeholder expectations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Led the development of an Excel VBA-based solution for a unique product—a challenge no
                    team member, including myself, had prior experience with. Learned Excel VBA from scratch
                    to process and transform data from distinct sources, creating tailored and customizable
                    reports. This process was subsequently reviewed, refined, and improved by me for cleaner
                    code, process efficiency, and enhanced user experience during product selection at process
                    initiation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Researched and documented the secured data derivation process, mapping all processes,
                    transformations, and variables on a JIRA IO diagram. This helped facilitate the precise
                    implementation of changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Achieved an exceptional performance appraisal in my first year. My line manager
                    acknowledged the significance of this accomplishment and noted that it was a remarkable
                    feat which no other colleague that he managed had attained and demonstrated my
                    dedication, adaptability, and substantial contributions to the team's success.

                <p>
                    Inherited data quality controls that I coded and implemented in SAS over a 4-phase testing
                    cycle. During the testing process, I investigated defects and communicated results to senior
                    stakeholders and 3rd party contractors and was responsible for suggesting a testing priority
                    system as well as introducing parallel processing to the testing team which significantly
                    reduced the testing period and allowed us to meet tight deadlines. For my endeavors on
                    this project, I was awarded a top recognition award that was across Credit Risk; 4 months
                    into my role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designed, coded (SAS) and implemented over 1000 data quality controls across numerous
                    variables and repositories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designed the IRB Data Quality infrastructure on our SAS server that will be used for future
                    BAU Data Quality Assurance processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Created code (in SAS) that would dynamically and efficiently generate aggregate statistics
                    (Sum,Average,PSI,CSI,etc) across selected variables and datasets using hash functions to
                    partition data into similarly sized chunks for quicker processing. I am currently developing
                    automated Time Series and I-MR charts in Excel off the back of this data to put into a pack,
                    that will be used to highlight irregularities and discrepancies to senior stakeholders using
                    Nelson’s rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earned an enhance Spotlight award for aiding colleagues across Credit Risk to find technical
                    solutions to their operational data model data quality checks whilst aiding the technical
                    development of partners in delivery of that project.

                <p>
                    From scratch, I learned the SAS language and business functions of numerous BAU
                    processes, taking command of multiple code request changes within applicable code-
                    members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ensure multiple BAU tasks, which I have inherited or created, are ran timely and successfully
                    with any possible data issues highlighted and investigated.

                    Automate and optimise several lengthy manuals “copy and pasting” Excel processes end to
                    end in SAS. This involved examining how data is manipulated and sourced before converting
                    said processes into SAS code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Implemented handover code into production environment. Involved analysing and
                    optimising code to be production ready, identifying data reconciliation issues where present
                    and highlighting issues to stakeholders which may influence business operations.

                    Automated manual creation of Jira Epic templates in Python. Aided colleagues in
                    understanding basic Python concepts and syntax in preparation of business transition from
                    SAS to Python.
