                This was a really fun project to get into and one that was completely out of my comfort zone.
                My career has taken me down the path of being a SAS developer and data analyst but truth be told I enjoy the creative problem solving aspect that
                coding often presents. I'm always looking to learn new things and this was a great opportunity to do just that!

            <p class="about-me-p">The first time you talk to me, you might be a little confused as to why a person named Ricardo
                has a Scottish accent! I was born in Edinburgh to two Portuguese parents and have lived here near my whole life, going to both school and university here.
                Edinburgh is a beautiful city, which is why i'm still here, and my current favourite pastime is just to go on long walks alongside the beach with my partner, Yun.
                Cheesy, I know!

            <h3 class="about-me-title">Sports</h3>
            <p class="about-me-p">I really enjoy to both watch and partake in playing football as i'm sure you've seen by some of my photos here! I support Tottenham Hotspur
                which is a bit of a strange choice for someone who lives in Scotland (and likes watching good football) but I have my reasons! I also like playing badminton and generally have been
                making more of an effort to do exercise since I tend to spend a lot of time sitting down at a computer.

            <h3 class="about-me-title">Games</h3>
            <p class="about-me-p">Another hobby of mine, which is fairly common for coders, is gaming! I've always enjoyed playing video games as a child and much like
                the image above, is something I have not outgrown! I love playing Pok√©mon particularly because there's a really huge online community so it's very easy to play with others and organise
                competitive tournaments and just in general create a lot of fun with friends. Since my partner got me a PC, i've also been playing a lot of games on steam (a game distribution platform) like
                The Witcher 3 and Yakuza Like a Dragon.

            <h3 class="about-me-title">Anime</h3>
            <p class="about-me-p">One of the things me and my partner bond over most is to watch anime which is just basically Japanese cartoons. It's a very chill way
                to just switch off your brain and relax which is something i've grown to appreciate more recently. We both enjoy to watch Attack On Titan, which is something I would
                reccomend but I also enjoy watching others such as One Punch Man and One Piece.
