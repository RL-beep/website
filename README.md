This project was created as an attempt to practice the skills I had learnt from taking the Scrimba developer course and as a way to promote myself to any future employers and showcase the skills
that I have gained.

The contents inside are by no means perfect and I would welcome any constructive feedback which is way I have allowed this project to be public!
